# PySpark-KNN

# PySpark k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classification using PySpark on the Iris dataset. K-NN is a versatile machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. In this project, we use PySpark, a powerful framework for distributed data processing, to build and evaluate a k-NN model.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (3.6 or higher)
- [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html)
- Python libraries: PySpark, scikit-learn

You can install the Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pyspark scikit-learn

Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pyspark-knn-project.git
cd pyspark-knn-project
Ensure that you have Apache Spark properly installed and configured on your system.

Run the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python pyspark_knn_project.py
View the accuracy of the k-NN model on the Iris dataset.
Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

bash
Copy code
pyspark-knn-project/
  ├── pyspark_knn_project.py  # Main Python script
  ├── README.md               # Project documentation (you are here)
  └── images/                 # Images and visualizations
Usage
Modify the pyspark_knn_project.py script to customize the k-NN model or dataset.
Experiment with different hyperparameters, such as the number of neighbors (k), to optimize model performance.
Explore additional evaluation metrics beyond accuracy for a more comprehensive analysis.
Results
The project demonstrates how to build a k-NN classification model using PySpark and evaluate its performance on the Iris dataset. The accuracy achieved on the test data is reported in the console output.
